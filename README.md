# hello-world
My first GitHub repository to start some ideas

Using Python - either Anaconda jupyter-notebook or pycharm:
1. Program to search in a tree of files for string or pattern
2. Use configuration file to define:
  2.1 root_path for the search
  2.2 file_extention - a list of file extentions for search (example: dtsx, sql, txt ...)
  2.3 search_patterns - regexp patterns for searching, for example: "select --- from table_name"
  2.4 chars_to_display - surrounding the matched string
  2.5 output_file - output file name, "console" for direct output
3. Package the program to be distributed
