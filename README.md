# hello-world
My first GitHub repository to start some ideas

Using Python - either Anaconda jupyter-notebook or pycharm:
1. Program to search in a tree of files for string or pattern
2. Use configuration file to define:
	root_path for the search;
	file_extention - a list of file extentions for search (example: dtsx, sql, txt ...);
	search_patterns - regexp patterns for searching, for example: "select --- from table_name";
	chars_to_display - surrounding the matched string;
	output_file - output file name, "console" for direct output.
3. Package the program to be distributed
